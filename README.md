# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

This project focuses on developing a system to accurately classify diverse bird images using deep learning techniques. The core of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is fine-tuned with pre-trained models and utilizes softmax activation for classification. The primary goal is to achieve precise and efficient image categorization through advanced deep learning methodologies.

Features
  1) Image Classification: Classifies diverse bird images into specific categories.
  2) CNN Architecture: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and classification.
  3) Transfer Learning: Fine-tunes pre-trained models to enhance accuracy.
  4) Softmax Activation: Employs softmax activation for multi-class classification.
